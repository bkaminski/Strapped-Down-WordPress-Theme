Description: The Strapped Down Theme is designed for a wide array of use cases. From a start up business website or a restaurant/bar, to a blogger and beyond. Strapped Down is built on a solid foundation of technologies (React.js, Node.js, Bootstrap) and includes easy to update "Theme Customizer" functionality. I would like to thank the good people at Codeable.io for creating a starter theme for WordPress with a built in Gulp workflow.<a target="_blank" href="https://codeable.io/introducing-sip-a-starter-theme-with-gulp-workflow/">Theme developers, Read this article!</a>.
