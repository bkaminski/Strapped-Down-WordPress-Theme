### Concept:
I really wanted to design this theme around an idea I had regarding different ways to present the WordPress loop within a theme. For "Strapped Down" I decided to run with my Windows 10 "Live Tile" style (Bootstrap 4.0.0) cards. The great thing about the new Bootstrap "cards" is there ease of use with flex-box. I also like the "live tile" style of presenting information, so I combined these ideas for the main portion of the home or "front-page.php" and I think you will enjoy it.

I had originally planned on releasing this to the public a few months back but wanted to get enough live testing (with my own website) in before I made a public release. So, my plan is to strip what you see of any and all of my current branding whlile maintaining and adding functionality as if I were delivering the product to the client. I plan to use WordPress Theme Customizer functions to allow for easy customization in making the theme your own.

## Alpha Version:
The first public release will be on Wordpress.org and maintained here. I will be creating a new branch for the alpha release and a new branch for every subsequent release to follow depending on feedback and popularity.
